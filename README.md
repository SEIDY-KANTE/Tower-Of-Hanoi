## üéÆ What Is Tower of Hanoi? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Wikipedia</a>

The **Tower of Hanoi** is a classic mathematical puzzle consisting of three pegs and a number of discs of different sizes. The puzzle starts with all discs stacked in ascending order (largest on bottom) on a single peg. The goal is to move the entire stack to another peg following these rules:

### üìè Rules

1. You have 3 pegs and a set of discs.
2. You can only move one disc at a time.
3. You can only place a smaller disc on top of a larger one.
4. Move all discs from the first peg (A) to the last one (C).

## üìê Algorithm Explanation

The Tower of Hanoi problem has a well-known **recursive solution**:

- Move `n - 1` discs from source to auxiliary.
- Move the largest disc to destination.
- Move `n - 1` discs from auxiliary to destination.

### ‚åõÔ∏è Optimal Number of Moves

For `n` discs, the **minimum number of moves** is `2‚Åø - 1`.
